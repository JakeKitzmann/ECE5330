Goal:
    My attempt follows the "optimal prefix code" as shown in the book on page 214.
    I aim to create an algorithm to encode ASCII characters into a binary sequence,
    where each binary sequence is not a prefix of any other sequence, so that the
    characters can be written without delimiting.
